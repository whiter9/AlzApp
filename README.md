Live app at: https://inciteprojects.idea.rpi.edu/alzapp/app/alzapp/
Code available at: https://github.rpi.edu/DataINCITE/AlzApp

Independent project building RShiny web application to accommodate client-specified research inquiries, completed during Spring/Summer of 2022 in conjucntion with the Neural Stem Cell Institute (Rensselaer, NY) and the RPI IDEA.

This R Shiny application is a data-browsing tool that exposes a large corpus of scRNAseq data from organoid models of frontotemporal dementia and isogenic controls to the biologist and the general user.
